FIFA then commissioned a new trophy, the FIFA World Cup Trophy, which has been awarded to the winning team since 1974.

It is commonly used to predict the value of one variable based on the values of one or more other variables. The goal of linear regression is to find the best fit line that minimizes the distance between the actual data points and the line. This method is widely used in various fields such as economics, finance, and social sciences to make predictions and analyze trends. It is also a fundamental concept in machine learning and data science.'"
